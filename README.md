# XOOPS CMS Module   ![XOOPS CMS](https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/12771439?v=3&s=200)

**Planet**  is a comprehensive PHP version of XML Feed Planet that handles XML feed fetch, parse, display and archive for XOOPS, or: "a flexible feed aggregator". It downloads news feeds published by web sites and aggregates their content together into a single combined feed, latest news first.

**XOOPS Module Archive:** Modules in this archive are older modules for XOOPS CMS, and therefore some of them might not work with the latest XOOPS and PHP versions. 

However, please fork them and if you have any improvements and fixes, please share them back with us.

The upcoming "next generation" XOOPS CMS version is being crafted at: https://github.com/XOOPS
